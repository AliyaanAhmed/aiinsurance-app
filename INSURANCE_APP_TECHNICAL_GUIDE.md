# Insurance App Technical Guide

## Overview

This project is a Power Apps Code App built with Vite + React + TypeScript and connected to Dataverse. It delivers a premium insurance operations workspace for underwriting, quote management, renewals, analytics, product administration, templates, and supporting admin data.

The app follows a read-first, progressively editable model:

- Core records load from Dataverse through generated Power Apps services.
- Page-facing services normalize records, resolve lookups, stitch relationships, and prepare UI-ready models.
- Users work inside premium routed workspaces instead of simple single-record forms.
- Most operations update Dataverse directly and then refresh the local query state without reloading the entire app shell.

## Architecture

### Frontend stack

- Vite
- React
- TypeScript
- React Router
- Tailwind-based design system
- Lucide icons
- Power Apps Code App generated Dataverse services

### App shell

The shared shell is mounted from `src/components/layout/AppShell.tsx`.

It provides:

- Fixed left navigation
- Shared top header
- Route outlet for all pages
- Scroll reset behavior
- Shared role-aware navigation

### Role model

Defined in the app domain and role hooks:

- `underwriter`
- `seniorUnderwriter`
- `administrator`

Access buckets:

- `leads`
- `products`
- `admin`

Routes are protected through `GuardedRoute`, and sidebar visibility is filtered by access bucket.

## Main Business Processes

## Inquiry intake to quote

1. Inquiry is created in `aur_quotes`.
2. Inquiry detail loads related product, plan, broker/account, contact, emails, AI details, and consequence results.
3. Underwriter reviews AI extracted responses and edits missing values if required.
4. Underwriter reviews actions/outcomes and applies valid business actions.
5. Quote can be created directly from inquiry.
6. Quote is linked back to the inquiry and carries inquiry-linked context.

## Quote creation from inquiry

When creating quote from inquiry, the app:

- checks current inquiry
- derives quote name from inquiry number/reference + inquiry/customer context
- carries product and plan lookup
- carries AI summary
- calculates quote premium values from inquiry premium
- creates the new quote record
- refreshes linked quote list in the workspace

## Quote copy workflow

The app can duplicate eligible won quotes into the current inquiry:

- user opens copy quote modal
- user selects won source quotes
- app creates fresh active quote rows for the target inquiry
- inquiry quote list refreshes

## AI extracted response correction

1. Quote-detail response records load from `aur_quotes_details`.
2. User edits `aur_response` inline.
3. Only the affected row is saved.
4. UI refreshes in place without restarting the whole inquiry experience.

## Draft email generation from missing information

When quote-detail responses contain `No information provided`:

- user can trigger `Request a Draft`
- app opens/expands the email activity composer
- draft subject/body are prefilled
- message references missing business-rule items

## Consequence application workflow

The app supports different apply paths depending on consequence type/action:

- Case Control
  Updates inquiry status/statuscode and marks consequence result as applied
- Risk Score
  Adds configured consequence risk score to inquiry risk score and marks result applied
- Risk Summary
  Concatenates configured consequence risk summary into inquiry risk summary and marks result applied
- Notification
  Notification text is surfaced in the inquiry workspace notification UI
- Document/Email template
  Linked templates can be previewed from the consequence context

## Product to business rule assignment

1. Product editor loads available business rules.
2. Existing associations are determined from `cr058_productrulelink1`.
3. User associates or removes rules.
4. Product-specific rule map updates through the bridge table.

## Business rule import assistant

1. User opens assistant on Business Rules page.
2. User uploads spreadsheet.
3. File is parsed row by row.
4. Business rule create payloads are built from:
   - Rule Name
   - Category
   - Property
   - Inquiry Type
5. Records are created.
6. Table refreshes and imported rows are visually tagged.

## CRUD and Lookup Patterns

## General pattern

The app follows this pattern for most pages:

1. Generated service reads raw Dataverse records.
2. App service maps raw data to UI-friendly models.
3. Page consumes normalized models.
4. On save, page sends a focused payload through the app service.
5. UI refreshes only the affected area when possible.

## Lookup retrieval pattern

Lookup values are usually surfaced using:

- lookup id
- formatted value
- logical name

The service layer normalizes these into compact objects such as:

- `{ id, name1 }`
- `{ id, accountname }`
- `{ id, fullname }`

## Lookup update pattern

For Dataverse lookup updates, the app typically:

1. Resolves the target record id.
2. Constructs the correct bind payload through the generated service or request model.
3. Saves only the changed lookup field.
4. Refreshes the local record state after save.

Examples in the app include:

- inquiry -> account/broker
- inquiry -> plan
- quote -> plan
- consequence -> email template
- consequence -> document template
- product -> business rule bridge association

## Adding a New Dataverse Table

Recommended process for this project:

1. Add the datasource through Power Apps Code App tooling.
2. Confirm it appears in `power.config.json`.
3. Regenerate/verify `.power` schema artifacts and `src/generated/*`.
4. Create or extend an app-facing service under `src/services`.
5. Add a domain mapping in `dataMappers.ts` or a page-specific service mapper.
6. Keep page components consuming normalized models instead of raw Dataverse records.

## Performance Notes

The app already uses a staged pattern in several workflows:

- render the workspace shell first
- prioritize core detail fetch
- load supplementary panels afterward

This is especially important in:

- Inquiry workspace
- Quote workbench
- Product editor
- Business rule workspace

Recommended rule:

- load primary form context first
- defer secondary analytics, timelines, linked collections, and previews

## Notes

- This document reflects the current implemented app structure and workflows in the repository.
- Some tables remain available as connected datasources even if the latest UI now prefers another source for the same process.
- When adding new features, prefer extending the service layer first instead of placing Dataverse mapping logic directly inside page components.
